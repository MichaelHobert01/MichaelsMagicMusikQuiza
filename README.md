# Code Quiz

A code quiz application that presents users with a series of questions and tracks their score based on correct answers. Users have a limited amount of time to answer the questions. I didn't finish some of the features however. But I have to submit cause I have no more time.

## Features

- Clicking the start button initiates the quiz and starts a timer.
- Each question is presented one at a time.
- Answering a question leads to the presentation of another question.
- Incorrect answers result in a deduction of time from the timer.
- The game ends when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
- After the game ends, users can save their initials and score.

## Usage

1. Click the start button to begin the quiz.
2. A timer will start, and the first question will be presented.
3. Choose an answer for the current question.
4. After selecting an answer, the next question will be displayed.
5. If the answer is correct, continue answering the questions.
6. If the answer is incorrect, time will be deducted from the timer.
7. The game ends when all questions are answered or the timer runs out.
8. After the game ends, enter your initials to save your score.
